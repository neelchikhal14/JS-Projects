            coding.

            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

            Web 3.0 represents the next iteration or phase of the evolution of
            the Web/internet and could potentially be as disruptive and
            represent as big a paradigm shift as Web 2.0. Web 3.0 is built upon
            the core concepts of decentralization, openness, and greater user
            utility.
